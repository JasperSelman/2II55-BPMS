\subsection{Simulation setup}
In this section we describe the simulation of model 2. First we describe the setup, as tasks have been added and some task time distributions and probabilities have changed. After this, we describe the results of the simulation of this model. In figure \ref{fig:tasktimes2} we show the time distributions and performers of each task. In figure \ref{fig:probabilities2} we show the probabilities used for the gateways. Finally, in figure \ref{fig:resources2} we show the amount of resources used for the different roles.\\

\subsection{Simulation results}
In this subsection we describe the simulation results of the most important things that we expect to have changed since model 1, which are the flow time and the resource utilizations.\\

The flow time now is 39979.8 $\pm$ 229.3 minutes, which is about 27.8 days. This is a much higher flow time. This difference in flow time can be explained by the additional constraints.\\

The resource utilizations now are as shown in figure \ref{fig:resourcesutil2}. As we can see, most roles have similar utilization as in model 1. Clearly, the NSC employee has much less utilization than in model 1 as it now no longer actively waits for notebooks to arrive.\\

	Mail Department Employee & 28.4 $\pm$ 0.17 \\ \hline
	NSC Employee & 14.3 $\pm$ 0.13 \\ \hline
	Financial Department Employee & 18.3 $\pm$ 0.07 \\ \hline
	Departmental Executive Board Employee & 5.4 $\pm$ 0.13 \\ \hline
