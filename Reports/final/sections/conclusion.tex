Since we had already considered our design goals for model 1 very carefully, it was difficult to think of improvements for model 2.
Because of this, we mainly focussed on implementing the additional requirements in model 2.

The additional requirements in version 2 of the model obviously make the model more realistic.
Because of these changes to the model, it is hard to compare the two versions.
However, even though the second model has a higher flow time, we recommend implementing the changes, since there are more automated tasks integrated in the process.
