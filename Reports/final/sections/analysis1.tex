\subsection{Simulation setup}
In this subsection, we explain the time distributions of the tasks, the probabilities for the gateways (when applicable), the resources required per task and the resources which are available for the tasks. We use the truncated normal distribution to describe the time each task takes. This way, we prevent it from ever giving unrealistic values, like negative durations. We write the truncated normal distribution as norm(\textit{mean}, \textit{standard deviation}, \textit{minimum value}, \textit{maximum value}), where each value is in minutes.
