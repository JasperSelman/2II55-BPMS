% An implementable description of the process you chose.
% Make sure the textual description in combination with the BPMN
% model describes your process completely, such that someone else is
% able to implement the control flow perspective, the resource perspective
% and the data perspective. Please make sure the BPMN model is
% readable when the report is printed on A4.
% Workflow patterns Highlight and motivate each workflow pattern
% from Section 2.2 once.
% Soundness Argue that the control flow of the process is sound.
% Please note that the syntactic sugaring and hacks (e.g. the milestone)
% introduced for Bizagi are not considered for the soundness check by
% ProM. An argument that a model is sound could be the combination
% of a check by ProM and a manual analysis of these special parts.
