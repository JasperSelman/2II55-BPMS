As an additional requirement, the payment should be ordered to a "real" bank
using a YAWL external service call (a codelet):

The payment is ordered to an external service. The payment can fail, succeed
or be delayed. In case of delay, the payment should be ordered again a few times.
If the payment fails, the student pays at pick-up. Please note that it is not
guaranteed that repeatedly calling the external service will eventually result in
success or failure.
